TDD Principles
Red-Green-Refactoring

üî¥ Write a test which asserts some functionality of your software.
üü¢ Write just enough code that your program is able to pass the test case. Keep it WET.
‚ôªÔ∏è Refactor the code, e.g., applying DRY Principles. Don't abstract into an pattern too early, however.

TESTING PRINCIPLES
1. Tests define the specification of the application we are building. Because of this, unit, system, and integration tests should
test for functionality that should exist in an application, not just asserting its correctness. If it doesn't test something
useful and important, it shouldn't be written.

2. Pesticide paradox
Eventually, the tests will become a bigger problem than the defects you are trying to find.
If you run the same tests again and again, you'll likely have false confidence in your software.
If the tests you've written are brittle and not mocked properly, you'll spend more time fixing broken
test cases than making useful progress.

3. TYPES OF TEST CASES
FUNCTIONALITY - Tests the correct functionality of the application.
UNIT - Tests atomic, individual components of different parts of an application.
INTEGRATION - Tests combination of services in an application working together e.g. Backend & Database.
SYSTEM / E2E - Testing the entire service working as a whole e.g. from the point of a user making a request, and expecting feedback
BOUNDARY - Allows you to understand the boundary of correct and incorrect behaviour
ERRONEOUS - When things go wrong, it's handlded correctly. Also useful for detecting defects and bugs that exist outside scope.
STRESS - Testing a system with deliberatly intense tests in terms of volume, processing, load, to determine the stability of a given system
PERFORMANCE - Tests which measure some non-functional aspect of the system and that it conforms to those requirementes e.g. timing
SECURITY - Testing different methods to break a program, exploit points of weakness, or vulnerabilities and ensuring robustness to these attempts.
